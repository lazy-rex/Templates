# Templates

A [LazyRex](https://github.com/lazy-rex/LazyRex) plugin. Session templates: a named group of tabs and panes that starts together, in a new session or an existing one.

## Install

Check this repository out next to LazyRex, and add the plugin to the hub config:

```json
{"name": "templates", "path": "/path/to/Templates/templates.lua"}
```

The plugin loads its other files from its own directory, so keep them together.

## Tests

The tests use `../LazyRex` (the client library in `lib/` and the lab harness in `lab/`).
Start an isolated lab server first, and never point tests at your own Rex server:

```sh
../LazyRex/lab/server.sh /tmp/rexlab
REX_SERVER=unix:///tmp/rexlab/rex.sock node tests/<name>.mjs
```

- templates-plugin.mjs (mock hub)
- templates-lab.mjs, templates-layout-lab.mjs (lab)
